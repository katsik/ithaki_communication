# ithaki_communication

This program communicated with Aristotle's University of Thessaloniki's Engineering Dept. server Ithaki. The whole project is a part of the Engineering Dept.'s course of Computer Networks 1. 

Description:
The program sends a custom code to the server. Then it awaits for the server's response and acts accordingly. 

For the program to be functional one has to have included the Modem.jar file, which for security perposes is provided only by the professor's website (http://ithaki.eng.auth.gr/netlab/vlabProject.php [Username/Password required]) .

For any questions feel free to mail me.
